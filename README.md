### Project Description:
* Exosplorer is an Android app designed to bring the vastness of space exploration closer to the public. With Exosplorer, users can create their own highly customizable solar systems by placing planets in dynamic orbits around a central sun. The app leverages real NASA data to find the most similar exoplanets to those created by the user, providing insights into what makes these discovered planets alike and assessing their potential habitability using scientific formulas.

* But Exosplorer doesn't stop there â€” it also introduces a gamified element! Players will be able to lead a colony of "laikers," a dog army led by Laika, the famous space dog. Together, they must survive various real-world disasters that can occur on different planet types, making the exploration and colonization of space an exciting challenge.

### Key Features:
* Custom Solar System Creation: Users can design and create planets with adjustable properties such as mass, density, and orbital distance from a sun.
Real Exoplanet Data Integration: The app uses NASA's exoplanet data to match user-created planets with actual discovered exoplanets, offering a comparison based on scientific data.
* Habitability Check: A custom formula is applied to determine whether the matched exoplanets could support life.
* Laikers Colony Game Mode: Once a planet is created, players can invade and colonize the planet with the Laika-led dog army, facing different types of space disasters and planetary conditions.
* Interactive Learning: Through the game and data, users gain a deeper understanding of planetary science and the potential for life beyond Earth.

### Technologies Used:
* Android Development: Java, Android Studio
* Data Analysis: Python, NASA exoplanet database
* Game Design: Custom physics-based algorithms for orbit and habitability simulation
* User Interface: Material Design
* Data Integration: NASA Open Databases for real-world planetary data
---
### How It Works:
* Create Your Planet: Start by creating a planet in a customizable solar system.
Match with Real Exoplanets: The app finds the closest match from NASA's exoplanet catalog and displays similarities.
* Check Habitability: Learn if your planet (or the real-world counterpart) could support life.
* Laikers Colony Mode: Command your dog army in a series of survival challenges based on real-world planetary conditions and disasters.
---
### Future Plans:
* Expand Planetary Interaction: Add more elements for interacting with your solar system, such as adjusting star types and adding moons.
* Advanced Colony Building: Expand the game mode to include colony resource management and space combat.
* Educational Content: Integrate more NASA data and educational material to make space exploration more engaging for users.

### Conclusion:
* Exosplorer is more than just a game; it's an interactive platform that blends creativity, education, and gaming to inspire curiosity about the universe. By incorporating real NASA data and simulating space exploration challenges, we aim to bring space science to a wider audience in an engaging and fun way.
